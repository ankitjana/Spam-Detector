# COMP 6721 Applied Artificial Intelligence (Winter 2020)
Project Assignment #2
A readme.txt (or readme.md) file that lists all submitted files with an explanation of their
content. It also must describe how to run your code for (a) training and (b) testing (including
generating the evaluation results provided in the report). If your instructions are incomplete and
your code cannot be run you might not receive any marks for your work.

## List of submitted files:
1.  model.txt: contains a list of vocabulary words, their frequency, and smoothed conditional probability of each class ham and spam
2.  result.txt: contains the name of each test file, its label (spam or ham) done by the model, its spam and ham score, the expected label and whether the model's classification is right or wrong
3. spam_detection.py: contains our code implementation for both training the model and testing it.

## How to run the program
*  To train the model, please run the following command: `python spam_dection.py`. The program will process all the training files in the *train* directory.
*  To test the model,
